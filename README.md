# BCData2018

Here you will find all code and images necessary to run the Jupyter notebooks for SSR 2018.

## To-do:

* Fix all source of code, should be independent of terminal running code
* Combine the two notebooks into a single notebook
* Screen shot of GPS plot, replace with screen shot so the pdf export looks nice
* Clean code, standardize notation and make easy to read
